## Run

The app needs a static server so it can `fetch` the JSON (browsers block local
file reads when opened directly):

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/quiz.html
```

Alternatively, just open `quiz.html` and use the file picker to load
`qa_dataset.json` manually.
